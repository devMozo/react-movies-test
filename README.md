# react-movies-test

-   Create a simple app –with Babel– using React, Redux and a router of your election
-   Choose the build tool you prefer – we like Webpack
-   Use any open API you feel more comfortable with – we suggest to use [TheMovieDatabase API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
-   The app should contain:
    -   A home page listing several categories of items
    -   A list page to show the items of a selected list
    -   A detail page of an item with more information
-   Nice-to-have features:
    -   An "Add to cart" button in item's detail page
    -   A cart to manage the products already added
    -   Live search
-   A minimum of clean CSS – do not waste time on fancy styles
-   Test as much as you can
-   Pagination -infinite scroll– not mandatory but desirable
-   SSR not mandatory but desirable
-   Create a README file with some documentation
